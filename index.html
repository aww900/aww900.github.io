<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

<p>I write novels in my spare time
  and I set up this website primarily as a means to publicise them.
  <em>The Road to Kadesh</em> is my first &mdash; a tale of revenge
  set during a war between two god kings, which features more chariot-related action than
  the race at the end of Ben Hur and climaxes with a huge and spectacular chariot battle.
  Some background notes can be found under the Novels tab above. I used its title for
  the website too, since I couldn't think of anything better. </p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<figure class="right"><img src="images/books.jpg" width="350px" alt="A Pile of Books"/><figcaption>A picture of some of my books, in lieu of an author photo</figcaption></figure>

<p>Most of the authors whose works I admire are dead (although
  I'd like them just as much if they were living). Their novels span a range of genres and styles,
  from Kurt Vonnegut's deceptively simple observational weirdness
  to the dystopian-esqe works of J. G. Ballard, and from the bleak Southern Gothic of Cormack McCarthy to
  John le Carr&#233;'s wonderfully cynical spy fiction and the hard-boiled poetry of Raymond Chandler. I even
  occasionally read SF. But if there's one genre I read more than any other
  it has to be historical fiction. There are plenty
  of modern authors whose works I have enjoyed, but few of them have equalled, and none have surpassed,
  the likes of Patrick O'Brian, George MacDonald Fraser and C. S. Forester &mdash; all of whom I think
  rank among the best in the genre. And then there's Mary Renault, an author who, if I absolutely had to choose,
  would be my favourite. I've read my copy of <em>The Last of the Wine</em> so
  many times its pages are falling out.</p>

<p>A few years ago, after finishing Renault's <em>The Persian Boy</em> on a train coming back from Paris,
  I decided to have a go at writing my own novels. I make no claim to be on the same level as any of the authors listed
  above; still, I hope my efforts provide enough entertainment to be worth the purchase price.</p>

<h2>What's Here</h2>

<p>A few introductory thoughts on historical novel writing and the perils of introducing too
  much realism can be found under the tab labelled Musings. Under Novels, along with notes
  on <em>The Road to Kadesh</em>, there is a page devoted to my current project,
  a piece of mythic fiction entitled <em>Anat</em>.</p>

<p>But there's more.
  I'm a theoretical physicist by training and I have included a page in which I evangelise about science.
  It can be found under the tab named "Science".</p>

<p>Everything here is only my opinion, informed by things I have read. Some of it may be wrong.
  None of it was created with the aid of generative AI, which I refuse to use.</p>
