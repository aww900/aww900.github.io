    <h3>What's new</h3>
    <p>Dec 2025. Added a page for <em>The Thief and the Vizier</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="content">
<h1>The Thief and the Vizier</h1>

<figure class="left"><img src="images/thief_cover.jpg" width="300" alt="Cover image of The Vizier and the Thief"/><figcaption>The novel's cover</figcaption></figure>

<p><em>The Thief and the Vizier</em> is the first novel I wrote. Set in Baghdad at the end of the eighth century,
  it tells the story of an ambitious young burglar who finds himself caught up
  in a feud between two gangsters, one of whom terrorises him into burgling the fortified mansion of his enemy.</p>

<p>The idea for the novel and its setting came to me while I was reading Richard Burton's
  translation of the <em>Arabian Nights</em> stories.
Burton's work is a remarkable, if slightly wonky, piece of late 19th century
scholarship and is worth reading for its footnotes alone, which reveal as much about the attitudes and prejudices
of Burton's times as it does the work he was translating. Further inspiration came from reading
  about the Abbasid caliphate during the reign of Harun ar-Rashid,
  who appears in a number of the <em>Arabian Nights</em> tales alongside his vizier Ja'far
and the mischievous poet Abu Nuwas.</p>

<p>Much of what we know about the history of the Abbasid caliphate and the lives of its inhabitants comes from al-Tabari's
multi-volume world chronicle, supplemented by collections of anecdotes such
as al-Masudi's <em>Meadows of Gold</em>.
According to al-Tabari, one of Harun ar-Rashid's sons, al-Amin, in order to ensure his eventual succession,
had a number of letters smuggled into Baghdad hidden in the hollow legs of wooden chests,
instructing his supporters on what to do on the event of
his father's death. The scheme worked and al-Amin's partisans were well placed to thwart his rivals
when Harun died unexpectedly while suppressing a revolt in Khurasan; one can
  imagine what would have happened to al-Amin had his intrigues been discovered.
  Thus was born the idea for the novel's MacGuffin: a post sack holding a letter whose compromising contents could fatally end
  the career of one of the caliph's viziers.</p>


<h2>Islam's Golden Age: Enlightenment and Tolerance... Towards Some </h2>

<figure class="right"><img src="images/courtiers.jpg" width="300" alt="Abbasid Vizier"/><figcaption>

<p> The first four caliphs (the term
  is an abbreviation of Kal&imacr;fat All&amacr;h, or Deputy of God) were
  Bedouin tribal leaders and former companions of Mohammed. In 661AD, after the Arabs'
  lightning conquest of the Near East and Persia, a new dynasty, the Umayyads, seized power
  after a civil war and the caliphate's capital was moved to Damascus. The Umayyads abandoned their old
  tribal ways and adopted the trappings of the ancient Persian kings, living
  lives of stupendous luxury and ruling from huge, sumptuously-decorated palaces.
  The Abbasids, who seized power on the back of a popular, pro-Alid
  revolt in 750AD, only added to the court's splendour and moved the capital to Baghdad,
  a city purpose-built from scratch by the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur.</p>

<figure class="left"><img src="images/harun.jpg" width="280" alt="Harun ar Rashid"/><figcaption>
    Another 16th century Persian miniature, allegedly depicting the caliph Harun ar-Rashid</figcaption></figure>

<p>The reign of the fourth Abbasid caliph, Harun ar-Rashid, saw a flowering of
  science and the arts. Poets, artists, natural philosophers and religious scholars blended the best
  of Arabic, Persian and classical Greek civilisation (the latter acquired via literature that had been
  earlier translated into Syriac by Nestorian Christians), creating a society that was
  rich, vibrant and highly cosmopolitan and which allowed a fair
  degree of social mobility &mdash; at least for a fortunate few.
  It was also an age of religious tolerance, where
  Jews, Zoroastrians and Christians (collectively termed "peoples of the book")
  thrived. Incidentally, the latter were largely Nestorians who, unlike their orthodox Greek and Latin counterparts,
  did not claim that Jesus was also God, and so were spared Muslim accusations of polytheism.
  Somewhat oddly the Muslims also had no problems accommodating Sabeans, who some modern scholars believe were a remnant
  of an ancient Mesopotamian pagan cult worshipping the moon god S&icirc;n.</p>

<p>Such tolerance only went so far, however. Non-Muslims (collectively known
  as <em>dhimmis</em>) had to pay a supplemental tax, albeit one
  that exempted them from military service, and there were times when
  Jews and Christians were made to wear distinctive clothing, and the latter
  forbidden from proselytising or building churches. Even practitioners of variant versions of Islam
  were persecuted, although often for political as much as religious reasons. Both the Kharijites
  and the Alids (the latter being Shia Muslims who traced direct descent from the fourth
  caliph, Ali) were ruthlessly suppressed by the Abbasids, primarily for refusing
    to acknowledge the caliph's rule as legitimate.</p>

<p>Then there were those religions not "of the book". The pogroms launched against Manicheans
  mentioned in the novel are a matter of historical fact; indeed, so ruthless were they that
  Manichaeism had become all but extinct in the Near East by the tenth century. Many other religions fared equally badly,
  as did a number of Islamic sects considered to be heretical; collectively, practitioners
  of such faiths were known by the pejorative term <em>zindiq</em>. This was an age when
people took religion very seriously and in such an atmosphere the mere accusation of deviant
  belief could be fatal to the recipient. Incidentally, Silas, one of the two gangsters in the story,
  is a somewhat unorthodox Manichaean, given that the sect eschewed the acquisition of wealth. His eccentricity
  is perhaps excusable given that he is criminally insane.</p>

<h2>The Damned and the Saved</h2>

<p>At the time the novel is set the Sunni consensus had yet to be reached and Islam was
something of a hotchpotch of competing creeds, including, among others,
  Mu'tazilites, Qadarites, Murji'ites and Kharijites &mdash;
  not to mention the various types of Shia Islam, which grew out of a movement
  supporting Mohammed's cousin Ali as the Prophet's
  successor. Many of their doctrinal differences would be incomprehensible to modern secular
  humans, and are almost equally baffling to many who profess to follow one of the Abrahamic
  faiths. Theological arguments never stopped, with topics ranging from the
nature of the Qur'an (was it created by God as it was dictated
  to Mohammed or did it always exist?), to the degree to which one can anthropomorphise God and the
  question of precisely how one should wash before praying.
  (Does the requirement for hand washing also include the elbows?
  Must one wash one's beard or simply the exposed part of the face? And so on.)
  Last, but by no means least, were the (still unresolved) debates about determinism versus free will:
  God is omniscient, with knowledge of all future events, implying that humans lack free will, yet He also punishes us when we sin. How
  can one square this with the assumption that God is both just and merciful?</p>

<p>Although these issues might seem trivial to non-believers, correct practice was (and still is) of paramount importance
  to Muslims. As Mohammed once said: "My community
  will be divided into seventy-three sects, only one of which will be saved." Yet how to
  ensure that one was a member of the right sect? God was watching and on the Last Day, when He is destined
  to judge humanity, those who have not come up to scratch are bound for an eternity of hellfire.</p>

<h2>Abbasid Baghdad</h2>

<figure class="left"><img src="images/abbasid_palace.jpg" width="300" alt="Abbasid Architecture"/><figcaption>
    Part of an early Abbasid palace, showing the characteristic thick pillars and barrel-vaulted ceilings</figcaption></figure>

<p>Baghdad at the end of the eighth century was one of the world's greatest cities,
and the capital of the Abbasid caliphate at the height of its power.
Founded by the caliph al-Mansur in 762AD, it quickly grew into a metropolis
  of over a million souls; few places at the time could match it for size.
  Whatever remains of the original city lies buried under the foundations of its modern namesake,
and for details of its layout one must sift through the large body of contemporary
  literary sources. Fortunately this work has already been done by Guy Le Strange in his
  <em>Baghdad During the Abbasid Caliphate</em>, whose wonderfully detailed
  maps I have used as the basis of my own version of the city, making changes only to meet the demands of the plot.

  <p>Architecturally, the caliphate was very different from the fantasy worlds of the <em>Arabian Nights</em> stories or the
  <em>Prince of Persia</em> and <em>Assassin's Creed</em> video games, or even
  the (real) mediaeval Middle East at the time of the Crusades. There were no tall,
  crescent-topped minarets breaking the skyline: most mosques at the time did not have a minaret, and the crescent
would not become a symbol of Islam until the 15th century when the Ottomans (a Turkic rather than Semitic people)
  adopted it from the Byzantines. Abbasid architecture owed more to ancient Assyrian, Babylonian and Sassanid Persian
  styles: squat, heavy-looking buildings made of mudbrick and decorated with painted stucco,
  with thick-set pillars and buttresses, and barrel-vaulted ceilings.</p>

<h2>The Great Jihad</h2>

<p>Alongside revolts and outbreaks of heresy the Abbasid caliphate had to contend with the threat posed by
  the Roman empire. The western, Latin half had long since collapsed, but the eastern Greek
  part (now known as the Byzantine empire and which had been Christian since the fourth
  century) was still going strong, despite its huge loss of territory during the seventh century Arab
  conquests. The two great powers
were in a permanent state of religious war, and the caliphs considered their military
  campaigns against the Roman infidels to be as much a sacred duty as their pilgrimages to Mecca.</p>

<p>Most of the fighting was in the form
of small-scale, albeit brutal, border clashes, but there
were years when the caliphate would attempt a more sizable invasion, such as in 782 when Harun ar-Rashid lead an army
to the eastern shore of the Bosporus, just across the water from Constantinople (an achievement only eclipsed by that
of the Umayyad caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, who managed to get his army across the Bosporus to lay siege
to the Byzantine capital). Despite their mutual antipathy, the Christian and Islamic rulers occasionally exchanged letters, some of which were cordial, and the states
  enjoyed a mutually profitable trade relationship. They also hosted each others' political refugees.

<h2>Farting in the Mosque and Other Misdeeds</h2>

<figure class="right"><img src="images/abudulaf_mosque.jpg" width="300" alt="Abbasid Mosque"/><figcaption>Part of the Abu Dulaf mosque, mid ninth century</figcaption></figure>

<p>During Abbasid times mosques functioned not so much as sacred spaces but as general-purpose public arenas,
  and fulfilled much the same role as the old Roman forums. When not used for prayer they played host to orators,
  teachers, fortune tellers, prophets, street entertainers and many others, and often contained open air markets.
  They were also magnets for beggars, thieves and other scoundrels, whose many tricks and schemes &mdash;
  including farting during prayers as a means of raising money &mdash;
  are described in Clifford Bosworth's excellent <em>The Mediaeval Islamic Underworld</em>,
  a book that, despite its title, also covers much of the Abbasid period.
  Within its pages one finds details of all sorts of scams and tricks once practiced by the underclass in Islamic lands, far more than I could
  include in one novel (who knew what use thieves could put a tortoise to?). Perhaps they will one day
  appear in a sequel.</p>

<h2>Stain Your Prayer Rug With Wine</h2>

<figure class="left"><img src="images/idle_rich.jpg" width="350" alt="Idle Rich"/><figcaption>The idle rich enjoying a well-deserved afternoon of relaxation</figcaption></figure>

<p>The above quote is from a poem by Hafez of Shiraz, a 14th century Persian Sufi and poet.
Sufism is a mystical form of Islam, and many of its practitioners use wine to get
closer to God.</p>

<p>To non-Sufi Muslims such behaviour is usually considered beyond the pale;
  indeed, many Sunni and Shia Moslems to this day consider Sufis to be apostates. But does God really
  forbid the drinking of alcohol? The Qur'an is unclear on the issue: in one verse God
  calls wine drinking a heinous sin, in another He merely forbids those from praying while
  drunk, recommending that the intoxicated Muslim sobers up first, while in a third
  He promises rivers of wine for those who reach Paradise.
  And does it matter what the alcohol is made from? Some think it does. For instance, the Hanafi
  school of Islamic jurisprudence believes that God only disapproves of wine made from grapes
  or dates and has no problem with alcohol made from grain, or other fruits.</p>

<p>What is beyond doubt is the hypocrisy of the Abbasid elite, who guzzled wine, played musical instruments
  and danced the night away as if at God wasn't watching. Of course, they were by no means the first,
  and certainly not the last, ruling class to adopt a "do as I say, not as I do" attitude. Indeed,
  given human nature, it would be astonishing, if not down right unbelievable, if they had not.</p>

<h2>Poetry</h2>

<p>Abu Nuwas, who plays a minor, albeit important, part in the novel,
  is considered to be one of the greatest of the classical islamic poets. Although
he was dissolute, sinful and disdainful of authority, much of his oeuvre was perfectly respectable
  and included elegies, eulogies, and poems praising hunting and wine drinking -- all derived
  from earlier, pre-Islamic forms or the later <em>Udhri</em> poetry from Umayyad times.
He was, however, a noted innovator, fusing old Bedouin and Persian styles
  and subverting expectations, particularly in his odes to wine, for which he was celebrated.
  But his wildness was never far beneath the surface and much of his verse was either
  blasphemous or downright filthy, while his character assassinations of his enemies could be brutal.
 Unfortunately his lyrical cleverness
does not translate well, relying as it does on the listener's intimate knowledge
of the Qur'an and classical Arabic to appreciate the puns and wordplay,
  some of which only make sense when one knows the shapes of certain Arabic letters
  (for instance, one poem uses the shapes
  of the letters <em>miim</em> and <em>laam</em> to suggest the act of anal sex).</p>


  <p>Many of his poems are thought to be autobiographical, and in the novel some of
his speech is taken from them. The incident in which he vomits on the carpet is inspired by an anecdote
set in Cairo where, in an alcoholic stupour, he collapsed and urinated over himself
while reciting verse. Thwarted by Aban, he never did gain admittance to the Barmakids'
    circle, although he did enjoy some limited success with the caliph and his successor al-Amin,
    both of whom had him imprisoned at least once for blasphemy and immoral conduct.</p>

<h2>Pictures of Mohammed and Other Surprising Things</h2>

<p>While trawling through various museums' online collections of Islamic art in search of
  inspiration I came across some unexpected and unusual finds. Some of the finest artworks
  produced in the ancient and mediaeval Islamic world can be found in illuminated manuscripts,
  of which there are hundreds still in
  existence, including Qur'ans, scientific and medical treatises, histories, books of poetry and collections of
  fables and anecdotes. A few examples appear on this page, and they are as intricate as they are exquisite.
  Surprisingly, many portray human beings (a practice that is often considered
forbidden to Muslims); more surprising still, some portray Mohammed (the depiction
  of whom can get one into serious trouble nowadays). It appears that there
  was once a market for biographies of the Prophet, and these often contained illustrations depicting important
  events in his life. There are hundreds of these images
  in museums all over the world.</p>

<figure class="left"><img src="images/dancers.jpg" width="300" alt="Nude Dancers"/><figcaption>A silk patch designed to be sewn onto a tunic</figcaption></figure>

<p>Another surprising find is shown nearby. It is a silk patch designed to be sewn onto a linen
  tunic, either at the front, back or shoulder (one can still see the sewing thread on the
  right hand side), and dates from the late Umayyad or early Abbasid era.
  It very clearly shows a pair of semi-naked women dancing.
  Apparently such decorative patches were common in the eighth century. How the Islamic world has changed.<br><br><br></p>


<h2>I Am the Law</h2>

<p>A good chunk of the Qur'an is devoted to describing things that God does and does not approve of, and warnings
  of the ghastly fate in store for those who stray from the true path. Unfortunately,
  when taken together, God's pronouncements do not form even the beginnings of a workable legal code.
  So Muslim jurists, mindful that Judgement Day is coming and that people need
  to know how to behave if they are to avoid being cast into the Fires, turn to the Sunna (the examples
  set by the Prophet, as recorded in a collection of anecdotes known as Hadith)
  to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>The sum of all God's requirements for human behaviour
  is termed Sha'ria and represents Islamic law in its pure, idealised form, and can
  in principle be gleaned in its entirety from the combination of the Qur'an and the Sunna.
  Unfortunately there are hundreds of thousands of separate Hadith, many of
  dubious authenticity; worse, they often contradict each other, the Qur'an, or both.
  Trying to divine God's intentions in this vast body of literature is no easy task, and many jurists
  admit that their earthly interpretations of Islamic law will always remain only flawed reflections of the divine ideal.
  It does not help
  that, over the centuries, several different schools of Islamic jurisprudence have evolved, differing
  not only in interpretations of points of law but the degree to which a religious scholar is permitted
  to use his own reasoning to supplement the corpus of tradition.</p>

<figure class="right"><img src="images/scholar.jpg" width="300" alt="Jurist"/><figcaption>A jurist and his students, 13th century Baghdad</figcaption></figure>

<p>Sha'ria is, of course, a body of religious law, and unlike modern secular equivalents is concerned not so much
  with the dealings of humans with each as with their relationship with God.
  Muslim jurists divide all acts into five categories: mandatory,
encouraged, neutral, discouraged and forbidden. Thus, for example, fasting, alms giving and daily prayer
  are mandatory; praying more than five times each day or regularly reciting
  the Qur'an are encouraged; giving something to someone using the left hand or praying in a garment
  that does not cover the shoulder are discouraged; usury, fornication, shaving the beard or converting to
  Christianity are forbidden; and so on. In the eyes of both God and Muslims all of this matters immensely, because
  a person who commits too many forbidden acts and not enough mandatory ones risks damnation.</p>

<p>It took centuries for the concept of Sha'ria and the whole other apparatus of Islamic
  legal theory to become fully developed, and in the period the novel is set matters were far less
  certain. During Umayyad times legal issues between Muslims were decided on the fly by the caliphs and their appointees,
  using a combination of expediency, local pre-Islamic legal traditions, Bedouin custom,
  and bits and pieces from the Qur'an and the Sunna. Later caliphs appointed <em>qadis</em> (i.e. judges)
  to make rulings on points of law, and gradually the whole edifice of Sh'aria, as described
  above, fell into place, being completed largely by the end of the tenth century.</p>

<p>Law enforcement was in the hands of various bodies, among whom
  were the <em>muhtasib</em> and the <em>shurta</em>. The former were market inspectors, and had the job of ensuring that traders did not
  commit sins such as fixing weights, adulterating flour and grain with sand, and short-changing their customers. But according to some
  sources they were expected to enforce Sha'ria more generally, acting in a similar role to the so-called
Morality Police in modern Afghanistan and Iran, and were empowered to administer
summary punishments. By contrast, the <em>shurta</em>,
who were an elite branch of the army, were responsible more for quelling public disorder
and hunting down bandits and the like. However, given the overlap between the concepts of sin and crime, there was a corresponding degree of overlap between the duties of the two bodies.</p>
