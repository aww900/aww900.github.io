<h1>In Search of Historical Accuracy</h1>

<p>It takes me some time to write a novel, primarily because of the amount of background
  research I do. For each of my novels I have collected a bookshelf full of text books and a stack of academic papers,
  not only so I can accurately describe the inhabitants' material world but also to portray their
  mental processes in an authentic way.</p>

<h2>Ancient Thinking</h2>

<p>I have spent years reading about the ancient Near East and learning, off and on, to read
  Akkadian, the language of ancient Babylonia and Assyria. Working through the exercises in my
  <em>Teach Yourself Babylonian</em> book I must have translated dozens of personal letters, contracts,
  royal proclamations, and extracts from
  hymns and epic poems, and have come to the realisation that
  these people were not quite like us. Of course, they had to deal with many of the same issues as
  we do, and much of their political, social and personal lives is familiar &mdash; they were, after all, the same
  species as us, with the same level of intelligence, basic needs and set of emotions.
  But there is much about their psychology that appears to be very different to that of modern, post-Enlightenment
  humans.</p>

<p>For a start they laboured under an almost suffocating degree of superstition.
  The world was a scary and mysterious place. Why does the sun rise and set? Why does drinking beer make you
  at first happy and then maudlin? Why do people die? Why is sand yellow? Why does the Nile keep flooding? Why has
  my neighbour just been eaten by a crocodile? Why does a dropped stone fall but flames appear to go up? What is the sky
  made of and why doesn't it fall down? And so on. To ancient humans, the only conceivable
  explanation for <em>anything</em> was "the gods made it so".</p>

<p>Then there was the lack of "me-ness" that makes up a large part of the modern
  Western psyche. We cherish personal liberty, believe that there is such a thing as human rights,
  and have a notion that the Universe ought to be somehow "fair" (and are sometimes
  deeply unhappy when we find that it isn't). The ancients, by contrast, were less individualistic
  and far more fatalistic, seemingly resigned to the inevitability of suffering and death. One reason
  may be that they had very little control over their environment: when at any moment one's village can be swept
  away by a flood or decimated by plague, neither of which one can predict, prevent or explain (see above),
  one's outlook must inevitably be coloured by a touch of fatalism.</p>

<figure class="left"><img src="style/nemrut2.jpg" alt="An Ancient Ruin"/>
  <figcaption>"Go to the ruin heaps and walk about; examine the skulls of high and low;
    which is the malefactor, and which is the benefactor?"</figcaption></figure>

<p> The ancients also seemed more accepting of violence than we are, and more
  resistant to its harmful psychological effects. They also seemed to have less reverence for
  the sanctity of human life. This is not to say that they grieved over the dead any less than we do;
  rather, it is simply that they lived in a world where unexpected death was an everyday occurrence. Modern
  adults expect as a matter of course that all their children will outlive them, whereas the ancients
  expected they would have to bury more than half of theirs.</p>

<p>Perhaps this explains the pessimistic outlook that appears, to me at least, to pervade much
  of their literature &mdash; particularly
  that of the Mesopotamians. One of my favourite Akkadian texts is a 3000-year-old dialogue between
  a master and his slave, called <em>The Dialogue of Pessimism</em> by modern scholars. It is thought to have
  influenced the writing of the books of Ecclesiastes and Lamentations in the Old testament; interpreted in a certain way,
  it comes across as being pretty
  bleak. A short quote can be found beneath the nearby figure.</p>

<p>Some researchers even think that the people of the ancient Near East &mdash; particularly the Sumerians and Babylonians &mdash;
  viewed time differently from the way we do, seeing history as an endlessly repeating cycle of events in which change and progress
  did not occur, yet at the same time acknowledging the linearity of personal experience.
  Then there is the apparent blindness to physical reality &mdash; at least in some spheres of their lives. For instance,
  Egyptian physicians used crocodile dung
  to try to clean infected wounds, the idea being that the foul smell would
  draw the evil out of the patient's flesh. They also used ground-up lapis lazuli mixed with oil to treat
  eye diseases, and all sorts of disgusting mixtures &mdash; including, once again, dung
  &mdash; to cure baldness. None of these remedies could possibly have been effective; did nobody think to observe and take notes
  on what did or did not work?</p>

<p>And yet they <em>did</em>
  advance in some areas. Hydraulic engineering, architecture and military technology are a but few of the areas in which Egyptians
  and Assyrians in particular excelled, and one cannot build an efficient aqueduct or war chariot without observing
  what did not work previously and making improvements.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that ancient humans were stupid. Far from it &mdash; their architectural achievements, from
  the stupendous stone temples of Egypt to the mudbrick ziggurats and palaces of Mesopotamia, stand today as
  a testament to their ingenuity. It is simply that, unlike modern humans &mdash; who have no excuse for their
  useless superstitions and harmful beliefs in pseudoscience and quack medicine &mdash;
  the ancients did not have a long heritage of rationality and science on which to build their thinking.
  They lived in a world where tradition was more important than innovation,
  and ritual and superstition would always trump reason.</p>

  <h2>Too Much Realism is a Bad Thing</h2>

<p>When writing an historical is possible to take authenticity too far.
  By modern standards, many of the inhabitants of the past would be offensively sexist and
  bigoted, and in the post-Classical era fanatically religious
  to an alarming degree. There are also numerous practices which were perfectly acceptable in the past but now provoke
revulsion, and which should be included with care.</p>

<p>The first novel I wrote, which is set in Baghdad at the end
  of the eight century (and which may appear for sale some time soon), features as one of its minor historical
  characters a man named Abu Nuwas. He is regarded as one of the greatest of the classical Arabic poets,
  and even has a street named in his honour in modern Baghdad. Dissolute and ill-disciplined, he seems
  to have been both an alcoholic and a paederast; disturbingly, the latter trait was more socially acceptable
  than the former. It may be fun to write about his drunken antics but certainly
  not the paedophilia, a practice which most moderns &mdash; myself included &mdash; find abhorrent, and which in
  the novel I avoided.

<p>Then there is the issue of how to deal with religion. I find the subject fascinating, probably
  because I am an atheist. But I certainly would not enjoy writing, let alone reading, a novel
  in which the protagonist invokes God in every other sentence and has his thinking moulded entirely by the Church.</p>

  <p>My most recently completed novel, set in seventh century Constantinople, touches on the issue
  of Christian attitudes to Jews, which were almost universally unfavourable.
  Were I to stick to historical fact, almost all the characters &mdash; including the
  protagonist &mdash; would come across as offensively anti-Semitic.
    Even in the pre-Christian world, where religions were less hostile to each other
    and less concerned with restricting human thought and behaviour,
    attitudes to the divine could be
  off-putting. The remedy here was to tone down the more unpalatable aspects of the
  period's religious attitudes, reserving the most egregious for the story's villains.</p>

<p>An historical novel can only give an impression of what life was like in the past,
  seen through the filter of modern sensibilities.
  Often authenticity must be sacrificed to make a story that others want to read.</p>
