<h1>In Search of Historical Accuracy</h1>

<p>My writing goes slowly, primarily because of the amount of background
  reading I do. For each of my novels I have collected a bookshelf full of text books and a stack of academic papers,
  not only so I can accurately describe the inhabitants' material world but also to try to portray their
  mental processes in an authentic way.</p>

<h2>Ancient Thought</h2>

<p>For years I have been reading about the ancient Near East and learning to read
  Akkadian, the language of ancient Babylonia and Assyria. Working through the exercises in my
  <em>Teach Yourself Babylonian</em> book I must have translated dozens of personal letters, contracts,
  royal proclamations, and extracts from hymns and epic poems, and have come to realise that
  the people of the ancient world were not quite like us. Of course, they had to deal with many of the same issues
  we do, and much of their political, social and personal lives is familiar &mdash; they were, after all, the same
  species as us, with the same level of intelligence, basic needs and set of emotions.
  But there is much about their psychology that appears to be very different from that of modern, post-Enlightenment
  humans.</p>

<p>For a start they laboured under an almost suffocating weight of superstition, seeing the divine at work
  in everything around them. Why does the sun rise and set? Why does drinking beer make you
  at first happy and then maudlin? Why do people die? Why is sand yellow? Why does the Nile keep flooding? Why has
  my neighbour just been eaten by a crocodile? Why does a dropped stone fall but flames appear to go up? What is the sky
  made of and why doesn't it fall down? To ancient humans, the only conceivable
  explanation for <em>anything</em> was that the gods made it so. These same gods were usually capricious
  if not downright hostile, sending disasters in the form of plagues, floods, wars and famines seemingly on a whim;
  in response the ancients developed elaborate rituals in attempts to placate their deities, and
  equally elaborate, if ultimately futile, systems of divination &mdash; such as astrology and extispicy &mdash;
  in an attempt to read heaven's will and predict what disaster was coming next and when.</p>

<p>Then there was the lack of "me-ness" which makes up such a large part of the modern
  Western psyche. We cherish personal liberty, believe there is such a thing as human rights,
  and have a notion that the Universe ought to be somehow "fair" (and are sometimes
  deeply unhappy when we find that it isn't). The ancients, by contrast, were less individualistic
  and far more fatalistic, seemingly resigned to the inevitability of suffering and death, probably
  because their fates were entirely in the hands gods they could not entirely trust (see the above paragraph).</p>

<h2>Existential Gloom</h2>

<p> The ancients also seemed more accepting of violence than we are, and more
  resistant to its harmful psychological effects. They also seemed to have less reverence for
  the sanctity of human life. This is not to say that they grieved over the dead any less than we do;
  rather, it is simply that they lived in a world where unexpected death was an everyday occurrence. Modern
  adults, particularly in wealthy nations, take it for granted that all their children will outlive them;
  by contrast, in the ancient world &mdash; indeed, until relatively recently &mdash;
  most parents expected that they would have to bury a good proportion of theirs.</p>

<figure class="left"><img src="images/nemrut.jpg" width="300px" alt="An Ancient Ruin"/>
  <figcaption>"Go to the ruin heaps and walk about; examine the skulls of high and low;
    which is the malefactor, and which is the benefactor?"</figcaption></figure>

<p>Perhaps all this explains the pessimism that pervades much
  of their literature &mdash; particularly
  that of the Mesopotamians. One of my favourite Akkadian texts is a 3000-year-old dialogue between
  a master and his slave. Called <em>The Dialogue of Pessimism</em> by modern scholars, it is thought to have
  influenced the writing of the books of Ecclesiastes and Lamentations in the Old testament. Interpreted in a certain way,
  it comes across as being pretty
  bleak; a short quote can be found beneath the above figure.</p>

<h2>Innovation and the Weight of Tradition</h2>

<p>Some researchers think that the people of the ancient Near East &mdash; particularly the Sumerians and Babylonians &mdash;
  viewed time differently from the way we do, seeing history as an endlessly repeating cycle of events in which change and progress
  did not occur, yet at the same time acknowledging the linearity of personal experience.
  Perhaps it was this perception of time, coupled with a strong belief in supernatural agency,
  that caused them to be so hide-bound by tradition and blind to the benefits of reason and experimentation.
  For instance, Egyptian physicians used crocodile dung
  to try to clean infected wounds, the idea being that the foul smell would
  draw the evil out of the patient's flesh. They also used ground-up lapis lazuli mixed with oil to treat
  eye diseases, and all sorts of disgusting mixtures &mdash; including, once again, dung
  &mdash; to cure baldness. None of these remedies could possibly have been effective,
  and some would have been harmful; did nobody think to observe and take notes on what did or did not work?</p>

<p>And yet there are plenty of areas in which the ancients <em>did</em> progress, and to an impressive degree.
  The invention and development of writing, and improvements in agriculture and civic organisation, helped them to build
  city-based societies whose complexity almost rivalled our own. Some ancient civilisations, particularly the Egyptians and Assyrians,
  excelled in engineering, architecture and military technology; it is notable that the Assyrian were building huge aqueducts
  five centuries before the Romans. One cannot build an efficient war chariot or aqueduct without observing
  what did not work previously and making improvements. Why such methods were not applied to other spheres of
their lives I do not know.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that ancient humans were selectively stupid. Far from it. Their architectural achievements
  alone &mdash; from the stupendous stone temples of Egypt and mighty ziggurats of Mesopotamia, to
  the vast Assyrian network of canals and water
  basins &mdash; are a testament to their ingenuity and technical skill. It
  is simply that, unlike modern humans, who have no excuse for their
  useless superstitions and harmful beliefs in pseudoscience and quack medicine,
  the ancients did not have a long heritage of rationality and science on which to build their thinking.
  They lived in a world where, in many areas, tradition was more important than innovation,
  and ritual and superstition would always trump reason.</p>

  <h2>Too Much Realism is a Bad Thing</h2>

<p>In writing an historical novel it is possible, I think, to take authenticity a step too far.
  Many of the inhabitants of the past were unpleasantly sexist and
  bigoted, and in the post-Classical era fanatically religious to a degree that is incomprehensible to modern humans.
  They also indulged in practices that, while perfectly
  acceptable in the past, would provoke revulsion now.</p>

<p>The first novel I wrote, which is set in Baghdad at the end
  of the eight century (and which may appear for sale some time soon), features as one of its minor historical
  characters a man named Abu Nuwas. He is regarded as one of the greatest of the classical Arabic poets,
  and even has a street named in his honour in modern Baghdad. Dissolute and ill-disciplined, he seems
  to have been not only an alcoholic but a paederast; interestingly, at the time the former was considered
  to be a far graver sin than the latter. It may be fun to write about Abu Nuwas's drunken antics but certainly
  not the paedophilia, something modern humans &mdash; myself included &mdash; find abhorrent, and which in
  the novel I avoided.

<p>Then there is the issue of how to deal with religion. I find the subject fascinating, probably
  because I am an atheist. But I certainly would not enjoy writing, let alone reading, a novel
  set in the Christian world in which the protagonist invokes God in every other sentence and has his thinking moulded
  entirely by the Church. Yet such individuals were once common. And even in the pre-Christian world,
  where religions were less mutually hostile
    and less concerned with restricting human thought and behaviour, one encounters beliefs and practices which
    a modern audience would find unpalatable.</p>

  <p>My most recently completed novel, set in seventh century Constantinople, touches on the issue
  of contemporary Christian attitudes to Jews, which were almost universally unfavourable.
  Were I to stick to historical fact, almost all the characters &mdash; including the
  protagonist &mdash; would come across as offensively anti-Semitic.
        The remedy here was to reserve the most egregious of the period's religious attitudes
    for the story's villains.</p>

<p>It takes skill to write a novel that gives an entirely authentic picture of the past without driving away one's readers.
  Mary Renault could do it, as could George MacDonald Fraser with his Flashman novels (whose protagonist
  displays attitudes which are <em>meant</em> to offend). I do not think I can do the same,
  and so in my writing I offer a slightly sanitised view of the past, and hopefully in doing so produce stories that
  others might enjoy reading.</p>
