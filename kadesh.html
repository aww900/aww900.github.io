<h1>The Road to Kadesh</h1>

making his world a better place</figcaption></figure>

<p> I began writing <em>The Road to Kadesh</em> one evening in an Indian restaurant. As I sat sipping
  my beer and waiting for my food to arrive the vision of a chariot battle began to unfold before my inner eye, in a cinematic
  riot of dust, noise and violence. Immediately I scribbled a hurried draft of the novel's opening scene,
filling an A4 sheet of lined paper with tiny biro writing. I still have that turmeric- and beer-stained
  piece of paper somewhere. From that opening battle the novel grew,
  the plot developing as I wrote. I had no plan; all I knew was that I wanted the battle of Kadesh
  to feature somewhere.</p>

<p><em>The Road to Kadesh</em> is not the first novel I have written but is the first I am selling,
  possibly because it has the best title. There are links on the right showing a few websites where it
  can be purchased. A cover image is shown above; taken from the Kadesh inscription at the Ramesseum in the Theban Necropolis,
  it depicts Ramesses II in his chariot slaughtering his way through a horde of floundering Hittites.
  According to New Kingdom Egyptian ideology, if foreigners were left to go about their business
  unchecked famine would stalk the land, the earth and sky would mix and the sun would no longer
  rise. So Ramesses, according to his lights, is simply doing the world a favour by killing some of its inhabitants.</p>

  <p>If you read the novel and like it do please leave a review on Amazon or Goodreads, so I know what went right. It may
encourage me to work on a sequel. Or perhaps something else entirely (see my <em>Anat</em> page).</p>

<h2>Some Notes on the Book</h2>

<figure class="right"><img src="images/scribe.jpg" alt="An Egyptian Scribe."/>
  <figcaption>An ancient Egyptian author (or scribe as they were known then)</figcaption></figure>

<p>In all my writing I try to present the historical world from my characters' point of view,
  avoiding as much as possible the imposition of my own standards and opinions
  (although there are limits: see my notes about this under Musings).
  This means, among other things, writing about their gods as if they were real.</p>

<p>Most of what is known about the religions of the ancient Near East, Egypt included, concerns
  the state cults, with their vast temples staffed by armies of priests performing
  elaborate rituals designed to keep the cosmos running on an even keel.
  By contrast, the spiritual beliefs and practices of commoners are still
  poorly understood, although the scholarly consensus seems to be that much of it involved ancestor
  worship and the veneration of local demigods. Where there are gaps in our knowledge
  I have invented freely, and have even once or twice contradicted established facts
  where I thought it would better fit the story.
  In other places, where the findings of archaeologists or my own imagination failed, I have relied for inspiration
  on the religious practices and myths of a rather remarkable place called Glorantha.</p>

<p>Unlike Egypt, little is know about the state religion of Amurru beyond
  the names of a few gods. To make up for this lack
  I have transplanted the entire pantheon from a place called Ugarit, a Canaanite city on the Mediterranean coast
  100km or so north of Sumur. There are many similarities between the religions of Ugarit and
  what would later, in the Iron Age, become Israel and Judah, and since Amurru is located somewhere in between
  these places I feel that my choice is justified. (For more information about Ugarit see my Anat page.)</p>

<figure class="left"><img src="images/el_sober.jpg" alt="The God El"/>
  <figcaption>The god El at the start of the evening's drinking: still upright and sober</figcaption></figure>

<p>The drunken ritual that takes place in the novel is my own invention, inspired by two
  historical sources.
  The first is the existence of an institution called the Marzeah &mdash;
  a kind of Bronze Age wine-drinking club, which is mentioned in a range of texts from various times
  and locales in the West Semitic world,
  including the Old Testament and some of the clay tablets found at Ugarit. One of its
  purposes may have been to allow the leading men of a city to gather in private
  and discuss business; alternatively, it may have simply been an excuse for the menfolk to go on an extended bender
  without their wives and children getting in the way. The second is a myth concerning the god El, who was the
  head of the pantheon at Ugarit (and, incidentally, is also
  one of the main gods of the Old Testament, where he is sometimes known as Elohim, the all-powerful sky
  wizard who creates the Universe in six days). Anyway, in the Ugaritic myth El and the other gods hold a feast
  in which they eat roast meat and drink wine &mdash; lots of wine. El becomes so drunk that he
  has to be carried home by his companions, whereupon he collapses "like the dead"
  and soils himself. The tale ends with what some think is a recipe for a hangover cure.</p>

<p>Turning now to the historical events depicted in the book, it is known that Ramesses campaigned in
  Canaan in the fourth year of his reign. Unfortunately the monuments he set up to record his deeds
  are so weathered as to be illegible, so we have no idea exactly where he went or what he did.
  The campaign was very likely nothing more than a flag-waving exercise to discourage rebellion
  and bring wavering vassals into line, and the novel's battle against the army of defiant Amurrites is
  pure invention on my part.</p>

<p>Concerning events in the west, it is known that the Libyans became a serious threat only
  in the reign of Ramesses' son, although during the period the novel is set they were making
  enough of a nuisance of themselves to prompt Ramesses to begin constructing a series of forts
  along Egypt's western border.</p>

<h2>The Battle of Kadesh</h2>

<p>The only substantial account of the battle of Kadesh we have is Ramesses' own, repeated with only minor
  variations at five sites along the Nile valley. Each account comprises two large blocks of text
  (the so-called poem and bulletin) and a captioned set of images, and only when all three are taken together do
  they form a narrative whole. Noteworthy is their honesty in describing how close Ramesses
  came to disaster after being outwitted by his Hittite foes.</p>

<p>According to both the poem and the bulletin it was he alone who saved the army, fighting single-handedly against a force of
  2500 Hittite chariots. Some historians accept this figure at face value; others of a more
  practical bent point out that it would have taken over two days for that many chariots to cross the
  ford at the Orontes tributary, and the Hittite assault was more
  likely a reconnaissance in force comprising a few hundred machines, and which blundered into Re division on its way
  to the Egyptian camp.</p>

<figure class="right"><img src="images/chariot.jpg" width="300px" alt="Egyptian Chariot"/>
  <figcaption>One of the war chariots found in Tutankhamun's tomb</figcaption></figure>

<p>The traditional view is that the battle lasted for two days. However, the accounts
  describe Ramesses' victims on the second day as "rebels" rather than
  the "fallen men of Hatti" he fought on the first day. This has lead
  some Egyptologists to argue that Ramesses, rather than renew the fighting, spent that second day decimating
  his army as a punishment for cowardice &mdash; which was good for me, since having
  to describe yet another battle at that point would have brought on a debilitating case of chariot fatigue.</p>

<p>The identity of the relieving force which beat back the second Hittite attack and
  saved Ramesses is a matter of some debate. They are not mentioned
  at all in the written record, appearing only in the pictorial account as a mixed
  unit of chariotry and infantry, and are named in a caption
  as the Ne'arin. A common assumption is that they were a fifth division of troops raised at Amurru and dispatched to link up with Ramesses
  at Kadesh. Perhaps they were scheduled to arrive simultaneously with the main body; if so, it
  shows a degree of coordination between disparate parts of the
  Egyptian army that would have had Napoleon chewing his hat in envy, and means that either Ramesses was
  extremely fortunate in the way events turned out or that he was, indeed, a god.</p>

<h2>Change is Sometimes For the Good</h2>

<p>My version of the battle is as accurate as I could make it and only veers from the scholarly consensus
  in a few places. For the most part I have been deliberately vague about the numbers of chariots present,
  suggesting in places that only a few hundred Hittite machines were involved in the attack on the Egyptian
  camp, and elsewhere describing the dust, noise and chaos of a clash between thousands on each side.
  I also, somewhat mischievously, made Ramesses' chariot driver
  Menna admonish the pharaoh for wavering near the end, whereas according to the monuments it was Menna
  who needed his back stiffening. I also compressed time by about twelve hours or so by
  having the Hittite attack take place on the same day that Ramesses and Amun division arrived at the camp.</p>

<p>I have used the term Canaan to describe the entirety
  of the lands along the eastern Mediterranean, a region the Egyptians called Retjenu. Elsewhere
  I chose commonly-used geographical names, rather than consistently use solely Egyptian or local terms.
  One or two changes to geography were necessary to keep the story moving; in particular,
  I moved the Bahariya oasis closer to the Delta and made it representative of the
  western oasis complex as a whole.</p>

<p>Anyone wishing to follow the flow of the battle might like to consult a map, of which
  there are a number available online (and I apologise for being too lazy to draw my own).
  The available maps come in two flavours, depending on how one draws the course of the waterways.
  One set shows the initial Hittite assault crossing the Orontes itself; the other has them crossing
  at a ford on the Al-Mukadiyah tributary. I chose the latter, in conformity with most scholarly accounts.</p>


<h2>The Egyptian World View</h2>

<p>Pharaoh was a living god and Egypt was the centre of the world, a perfect land created during the First
  Moment by the great god Amun. Beyond the land's borders was uncivilised chaos populated by
  vile Asiatics, fallen men of Hatti, and wretched
  Libyans and Nubians &mdash; collectively known as "the Nine Bows", the number nine being another way of saying
  "many" or "countless".</p>

<p>The governing principle in any Egyptian's life was Ma'at, a term embracing a wide range of concepts
  including peace, stability, justice, good governance, prosperity, and a whole other raft of good things. Ma'at was
  also a goddess, often represented by a feather. When Ma'at was strong Egypt prospered,
  the pharaoh was wise and just, and foreigners were kept in their place; conversely, a weakening of Ma'at could
  lead to famine, disorder and foreign invasion. In a muddling of cause and effect typical of the ancient mind
  it also seemed to work the other way around, in that Pharaoh's actions could strengthen Ma'at or, if he
  ruled unwisely, could diminish it to a dangerously low level.</p>

<p>All of which helps explain why New Kingdom Egypt was such a highly militaristic society.
  Of course, strategically it made sense for them to conquer as much of Canaan as possible to create a buffer
  between Egypt and any potential invaders, most of whom came from the east. But Ma'at also had to be maintained,
  and to that end the pharaoh was under a religious obligation to
  suppress the foreign menace &mdash; primarily by slaughtering all and sundry in  battle and enslaving
  the survivours.</p>

<h2> Late Bronze Age Doublethink</h2>

<p>The Egyptians' exceptionalism and xenophobia, not to mention their creation myths, made Egypt
  the foremost nation on Earth, with all other nations being little more than Ma'at-less barbarians,
  there to be massacred, enslaved or ignored at will. But reality, as it so often does,
  had to intrude and spoil the conceit. The Hittites, Babylonians, Assyrians and Mitanni were great powers
  on a par with Egypt, and their kings every bit the equal of Pharaoh. These kings &mdash; Pharaoh
  included &mdash; regularly exchanged letters in which they addressed each other as "brother",
  wished each other well and asked after the health of their brothers' kingdoms, spouses and chariot horses.
  They also exchanged gifts, or begged shamelessly for gifts to be sent, made peace treaties and extradition
  agreements, and even dispatched their daughters to each other's harems.</p>

<p>How then did the pharaoh and his ministers reconcile these two contradictory world views, in which on the one
  hand Egypt reigned supreme, yet on the other was only one of a number of equally powerful states?
  In the novel I decided to have Ramesses largely believe his own propaganda and act as if he were indeed
  Egypt's living god, and gave his ministers and generals the job of reinterpreting his
  decrees to better match the reality of their situation.</p>

<p>Then there is the matter of how the Egyptians reconciled their xenophobia with reality.
  The cities of Egypt were highly cosmopolitan, hosting
  not only enslaved prisoners of war but also labourers, craftsmen and specialists from all over the Mediterranean world.
  For instance, archaeologists have found evidence that a team
  of Minoan artists was employed by the pharaoh Thutmosis III to decorate one of his palaces; they covered
  the walls in Cretan-style friezes. And in common with all other contemporary civilisations, the Egyptians readily assimilated
  other cultures' deities into their own pantheons, reworking their myths to make them fit.
  How did the locals square the presence of so many
  foreigners, and so much foreign influence, with their belief that they were a menace whose very presence
  would stop the sun from rising?</p>
